# WinHelmCream

My attempts to learn AKS and helmcharts with a windows focus.

## Oh crap

I tried to learn HelmCHart on a plane ride, with windows containers because I needed to use windows containers. Then I discovered you can't easily spin up a local kubernetes cluster with Windows containers.

I'm just pushing this up so I can wipe the machine in question.
