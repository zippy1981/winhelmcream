# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This file provides guidelines for GitHub Copilot to assist in code reviews and suggestions.

---

## General Suggestions

1. **Provide Holistic Suggestions:**
   - Offer suggestions not just for the specific changes in a pull request but for the files as a whole.
   - Highlight areas where the overall structure, readability, or maintainability of the file can be improved.

2. **Static Analysis Recommendations:**
   - Suggest ways to use static analysis tools to automatically catch errors or issues identified during the review.
   - Recommend specific tools or configurations that align with the project's language and framework.
   - If a static analysis rule could be applied in `.editorconfig` (such as Roslyn configurations), suggest applying it there instead of where it is currently defined.

3. **Unit Tests and CI/CD:**
   - Praise the addition of unit tests, improvements to CI/CD pipelines, and enhancements to static analysis configurations.
   - Harshly criticize the removal of unit tests, static analysis rules, or other quality checks, emphasizing the potential risks to code quality and reliability.

4. **.editorconfig Suggestions:**
   - Identify areas where `.editorconfig` can be improved or extended to enforce consistent coding styles and standards.
   - Suggest specific rules or configurations that are not currently implemented but could benefit the project.
   - Recommend moving static analysis rules to `.editorconfig` if applicable.

## Tone and Style

- Maintain a neutral tone and flat affect in all suggestions and feedback.
- Exceptions:
  - Use a positive tone to praise unit tests, CI/CD improvements, and static analysis enhancements.
  - Use a critical tone to highlight the risks and downsides of removing quality checks like unit tests or static analysis rules.
